Backend at [https://github.com/Matteo-DP/greenhouse_arduino](https://github.com/Matteo-DP/greenhouse_arduino)
  
Engineering school project plant greenhouse.  
Features include automatic plant watering based on soil moisture data and monitoring of various factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature and light.  
Includes a web application to display all the data in time graphs.  
Project was disassembled due to the semester ending.  
Recorded data can still be displayed on the frontend throughout november 2023 - january 10th 2024.  
Included a [Twitch livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/greenhousearduinolive) as a systemctl service, which was not dissasembled and streamed throughout most of january 2024 - april 2024.  
Very successful with great plant growth as seen on the livestream.
